# Python-Challenge
Python script helps analyze data sets of all kinds. In this respository, we have two diffrent projects, PyBank and PyPoll.

PyBank
Three files are under the PyBank folder. The budget_data.csv  is the data set, PyBank_Main.py is the code to run in python to analyze the data set, and PyBank_Analysis.txt are the results of running the python script. 

PyPoll
Three files are under the PyPoll folder. The election_data.csv  is the data set, PyPoll_Analysis.txt is the code to run in python to analyze the data set, and PyBank_Analysis.txt are the results of running the python script.
